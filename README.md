 I designed and developed a To-Do List App 📝 — a simple yet powerful tool to manage daily tasks, boost productivity, and stay organized. Built using [mention your tech stack: e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript / React / etc.], this project helped me explore essential concepts like CRUD operations, state management, and UI/UX design.
💡 Key Features:
 ✔️ Add, edit, and delete tasks
 ✔️ Mark tasks as complete
 ✔️ Clean and responsive UI
 ✔️ Data persistence 
🎯 This task not only refined my coding skills but also taught me the importance of user-centric design and effective time management.
